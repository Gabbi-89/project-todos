# Project Todos

In this project I have built a todo app by using Redux in React. 
The functions are that you can add tasks, list tasks, remove tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. By using local storage your browser saves the todos you have created!

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started the project by skecthing which components I needed. Then I started the code by creating the reducer with the information I wanted to be added in the tasks and with the actions. The actions did I add more of during the project when I had time for more and more actions.

I created a 'Task' component that shows the information for each task and that includes possibility to mark the task as completed and to remove the task fully. The 'TaskList' component maps through the tasks and show some other information regarding the tasks and the buttons.

In the 'AddTask' component I have created the functionality that adds task with the information we want; the task text, the category and the due date. 

I have used styled components mainly to learn that fully. Some of the styling that are used in several components did I add in a separate file for global styles.
